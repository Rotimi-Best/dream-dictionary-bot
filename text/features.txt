Welcome, I am a dream dictionary bot that helps you interepret keywords in your dream. 

Click /help to know what I can do.

Here is the book I draw my knowledge from: 
https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Dreams-Tella-Olayeri/dp/B0053B58RQ
I advice you to buy the book. Author: Tella Olayeri

To use my current version you need to buy the book.\n
In my current version here is what I can do:\n
1. You can check if a word is in the dictionary and find its page. To do this use /findbyword command and then the word \n
e.g /findbyword football \n
2. Show you all the words in a particular an alphabet. To do this use /findbyalphabet command followed by the alphabet \n
e.g /findbyalphabet p \n

In the coming version you can be able to find the interpretaions directly from the bot without the dream dictionary.
