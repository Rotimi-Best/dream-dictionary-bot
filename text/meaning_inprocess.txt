Hence, it is a favorable dream in your favor.\n\nOn the other hand, if your helper or loved one abandoned you in the dream it portrays success slipping off your hands, leading to set back. Pray to cancel such dream.\n\nIf in your dream, you abandoned something or somebody you hate in nature, it forecasts you will soon hear favorable  financial news or success on whatever you lay hands upon.\n\nIf you abandon someone close to you in the dream, it forecasts trouble and difficulties ahead. You can cancel the dream by reversing the actions that led to it. To dream you were a Witness to an abandonment of any kind, suggest You will hear very soon of, an important message that concerns you..\n\n*CASE STUDY*\n\nThere was this family with three kids, a boy and two girls.The mother was a professional nurse while her husbandwas a teacher. As things were not working ne as expectedand their children were becoming of age, the spouse reasontogether to try foreign employment for the wife. Within ashort while she was offered employment in Europe. Theman sold his only car, borrowed money from friends andrelatives, foot the bill to enable her wife travel abroad. Theagreement was that sooner or later the family will join thewoman overseas.\n\nAt the time they had the thought, this brother dreamt where he prostrated begging his wife not to pack out of their matrimonial home. In that dream, his entire plea failed before he woke from sleep. "Oh, it was a dream", he said. Yes, it was a dream but with meaning. As he did not bother to decode the dream, the result kept hanging in the spirit. I pray that evil shall not hang in the spirit for you. Amen.\n\nAt last this sister left the shore of Nigeria for Europe. In the rst two months she often phone her family. In the later months nothing was heard of her, she stopped calling. If her husband called her, she will pick the call only to say hehn, hehn, hehn, as if she didn't hear what her husband said. When her husband called her over twenty times without an answer, only to hear repeated hehn, hehn, helm, hehn, he stopped calling her. It was at this point this brother knew that his lovely wife has run after another Romeo in Europe.\n\nAfter about five years stay in Europe this sister phoned her erstwhile husband that she may come home to pick her rst daughter to join her take care of two babies she had for her new husband. On hearing this, her husband ran mad in anger and said, "Really these children are for us, but with signs and wonders I will give them sound education to any level they wish, but you shall not set eyes on them" This sister laughed and told her husband "Lu keep quiet, saying, "You poor church rat where will you get money", and then switched off her phone. To cut the story short, a week before her coming home, this sister was involved in a ghastly motor accident in which she died!\n\nQuestion that may come to mind is who killed this woman? Can it be the curse issued by her so called poor husband? Did he go extra mile to forment evil? Was the woman hunted by the spirit of the children she left behind? Was it her sin? Brethren, purse for a while and provide an answer to this.\n\nTo me the fault came from both sides. They neglected the importance of dream. If the husband was able to decode his dream earlier on, he may have stopped her from traveling abroad._Psalm 16:10, Nehemiah 9:1_

To see dirty or sluggish animal walking out of your body
in the dream portends spirit of poverty and ill-luck have

powers planted or living in you.

CASE STUDY
A sister in the course of deliverance saw a he goat, (very
dirty and smelling) walked out of her life. Then she woke
up. The meaning of this is that the satanic animal had
been the source of her stubborn and compounded
problems in the past. At 42 years of age, this sister had
no husband, nor job. She can best be described as Miss
Ill—Luck Poverty Agony. This was her likely baptism name
in the dark World. Spirit of he goat lived in her; she was

very stubborn and never take to correction. Not quite long
after deliverance, she experienced sudden, earthquake and

volcano breakthroughs. Once neglected sister found a
husband, secured good job, while her rst pregnancy were
triplets, two boys and a girl! Hence, I pray, any wild animal
using your body as abode shall be uncomfortable but walk

out of you and die, in the name of Jesus, Amen.
